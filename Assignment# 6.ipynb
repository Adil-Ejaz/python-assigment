    "# Question 1:\n",
    "## Define Object Oriented Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP is a paradigm in which real-world objects are each viewed as separate entities having their own state which is modified only by built in procedure, called method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2:\n",
    "## List down the Benefits of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.Reuse also enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.It provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.Better Productivity as OOP techniques enforce rules on a programmer that, in the long run, help her get more work done; finished programs work better, have more features and are easier to read and maintain. OOP programmers take new and existing software objects and \"stitch\" them together to make new programs. Because object libraries contain many useful functions, software developers don't have to reinvent the wheel as often; more of their time goes into making the new program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3:\n",
    "## Differentiate between function and method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "#### 2.A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4:\n",
    "### Objects \n",
    "\n",
    "#### In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. In between, each object is made into a generic class of object and even more generic classes are defined so that objects can share models and reuse the class definitions in their code. Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables. An object is what actually runs in the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword. The class is a blueprint that defines a nature of a future object. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. Classes are used to create and manage new objects and support inheritanceâ€”a key ingredient in object-oriented programming and a mechanism of reusing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes\n",
    "#### Attributes are the individual things that differentiate one object from another and determine the appearance, state, or other qualities of that object. Let's create a theoretical class called Motorcycle. A motorcycle class might include the following attributes and have these typical values:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Color: red, green, silver, brown\n",
    "#### Style: cruiser, sport bike, standard\n",
    "#### Make: Honda, BMW, Bultaco\n",
    "\n",
    "## Behavior\n",
    "#### A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them. For example, to go back to the theoretical Motorcycle class, here are some behaviors that the Motorcycle class might have:\n",
